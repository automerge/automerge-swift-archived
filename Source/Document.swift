/// A wrapper around your codable model that tracks collaborative changes and provides an immutable views of the model's history.
///
/// Use a document by creating a document around your model using ``Document/init(_:actor:)``, and update your model within a trailing closure provided by ``Document/change(message:_:)``.
///
/// The initializer takes an optional ``Actor`` parameter.
/// An actor has a ``Actor/actorId``, a string that uniquely identifies the collaborator.
/// if you omit the actor, an actor with a random ID is generated.
/// If you pass in your own actor ID, ensure that there can never be two different collaborators with the same actor ID.
/// Even if you have two different processes running on the same machine, they must have distinct actor IDs.
/// Unless you intend otherwise, don't provode an actor and let the actor be auto-generated.
///
/// Persist your document using ``Document/save()``, which writes a compact version of the change history that you can write to disk.
/// Create a new document from the binary data created from ``Document/save()`` with the initializer ``Document/init(data:actor:)``.
///
/// With a document representing the state of your model, and another document representing a collaborator's model state, get the changes using ``Document/getChanges(between:)``, and selectively apply them to either document using ``Document/apply(changes:)``.
/// The Automerge library is agnostic to the network layer.
/// Use whatever communication mechanism you like to get changes from one collaborator to another.
/// Note that ``Document/getChanges(between:)`` takes an old document state as argument and returns a list of all the changes that are different between the new and old document.
/// If you want a list of all the changes ever made in doc, call ``Document/allChanges()``.
///
/// The counterpart, ``Document/apply(changes:)`` applies the list of changes to the document.
/// Automerge guarantees that when two documents have applied the same set of changes — even if the changes were applied in a different order — the two documents are equal.
/// This property is known as convergence, and it is at the core of what Automerge provides.
///
/// You can instantiate a document from another collaborator with its encoded change history using ``Document/init(data:actor:)``, or using a list of changes with the ``Document/init(changes:actor:)`` initializer.
/// You can merge the collaborator's change history into your document using ``Document/merge(_:)``.
///
/// You can inspect the details of the change history by initializing ``History`` with your document.
